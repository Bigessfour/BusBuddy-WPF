# Ticket Management Module Deprecation Guide

**Last Updated:** July 10, 2025  
**Planned Removal Date:** December 31, 2025

## Overview

The Ticket Management module has been deprecated and will no longer receive feature enhancements or significant updates. This document provides information about the deprecation status, rationale, and migration options.

## Deprecation Status

- **Current Status**: Deprecated (as of July 10, 2025)
- **Maintenance Status**: Critical bugfixes only
- **Feature Development**: No new features will be added
- **Planned Removal**: December 31, 2025

## Rationale for Deprecation

The Ticket Management module was originally designed to support a passenger ticketing system for school districts that required fee-based transportation services. Based on user feedback and usage analytics, we found that:

1. Less than 8% of customers actively used the ticketing features
2. Most school districts have transitioned to free transportation models
3. Districts requiring payment systems have generally integrated with more comprehensive financial systems
4. Maintaining the module required significant development resources for limited benefit

## Migration Options

If you are currently using the Ticket Management module, you have several options:

### Option 1: Export Current Data

Before the module is fully removed, you can export all your ticket data to CSV format:
1. Navigate to the Ticket Management module
2. Use the "Export CSV" button to export all ticket data
3. Store the exported data for historical reference

### Option 2: Alternative Solutions

For districts that still require ticketing functionality:

- **Student Information Systems**: Most modern SIS systems include fee management capabilities that can be adapted for transportation fees
- **Payment Management Systems**: Dedicated payment systems like PaySchools or MySchoolBucks offer more robust solutions for fee collection
- **Custom Integration**: Contact our professional services team to discuss custom integration options with your financial systems

### Option 3: Limited Support Extension

In exceptional cases where migration by the removal date is not feasible:
- Contact your account manager to discuss support extension options
- Note that extended support will be available at additional cost and for a limited time only

## Timeline

- **July 10, 2025**: Deprecation announcement and visual indicators added
- **September 15, 2025**: Last day for reporting non-critical bugs
- **October 31, 2025**: Final maintenance update
- **December 31, 2025**: Module removed from the application

## Data Retention

After the module is removed:
- Historical ticket data will be retained in the database for reporting purposes
- Data will be accessible through the reporting module but not editable
- Data retention policies will follow your organization's standard database backup and archiving procedures

## Contact Information

For questions or concerns regarding this deprecation:
- **Migration Guide**: See `Documentation/TICKET_MODULE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed migration instructions
- **Technical Support**: Contact your system administrator
