# View Model Refactoring Changes

## Completed Tasks

### Task 4: Dashboard Optimization
- Added detailed performance metrics to DashboardViewModel
- Implemented PerformanceMonitor utility for tracking operation times
- Enhanced logging with timing information for each operation
- Added formatted metrics as properties for potential UI display
- Modified the initialization pattern to be more robust and trackable

### Task 5: AutoMapper Scalability
- Created view model classes with data annotations for all entities
- Implemented MappingProfile for AutoMapper configuration
- Added MappingService with performance tracking
- Set up extension methods for easy registration
- Created consistent mapping patterns across the application

### Task 6: Testing and Documentation
- Added comprehensive unit tests for DriverManagementViewModel
- Created test cases for critical functionality
- Added XML documentation comments to all new classes
- Created detailed documentation in VIEW_MODEL_REFACTORING.md
- Implemented consistent error handling and logging

## Required NuGet Packages

To complete the implementation, you'll need to add these NuGet packages:
- AutoMapper
- AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
- Moq (for unit tests)
- xunit (for unit tests)

## How to Use the New Features

### Performance Monitoring
```csharp
// Inject the performance monitor
private readonly PerformanceMonitor _performanceMonitor;

// Track a synchronous operation
_performanceMonitor.TrackOperation("OperationName", () => {
    // Your code here
});

// Track an async operation
await _performanceMonitor.TrackOperationAsync("AsyncOperation", async () => {
    // Your async code here
});

// Get a performance report
string report = _performanceMonitor.GenerateReport();
```

### AutoMapper Usage
```csharp
// Inject the mapping service
private readonly IMappingService _mappingService;

// Map an entity to view model
var viewModel = _mappingService.Map<Entity, ViewModel>(entity);

// Map a collection
var viewModels = _mappingService.MapCollection<Entity, ViewModel>(entities);

// Update an existing view model
_mappingService.Map<Entity, ViewModel>(entity, existingViewModel);
```

## Next Steps
1. Add the required NuGet packages
2. Resolve the dependency injection issues
3. Run the unit tests to verify functionality
4. Consider adding a performance metrics view to the settings panel
5. Extend the pattern to other view models in the application
