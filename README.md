## Database Schema

### Core Entities
- **Vehicles (Buses)**: Fleet management with insurance and maintenance tracking
- **Drivers**: Driver information with license management
- **Routes**: Route planning with AM/PM assignments
- **Students/Passengers**: Student transportation records
- **Activities**: System activity and audit logging
- **Maintenance**: Vehicle service records
- **Fuel**: Consumption tracking

## Theme Management System

### FluentDark Primary Theme with FluentLight Fallback
The application uses a sophisticated theme management system built on Syncfusion's official theming infrastructure:

- **Primary Theme**: FluentDark (official Syncfusion dark theme)
- **Fallback Theme**: FluentLight (available for theme switching)
- **Dynamic Switching**: Toggle between themes using the ThemeService
- **Automatic Fallback**: If FluentDark fails, automatically falls back to FluentLight
- **Theme Validation**: Invalid theme requests automatically fall back to FluentDark
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All theme operations include detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Theme Service Features
```csharp
// Available through dependency injection
public interface IThemeService
{
    string CurrentTheme { get; }           // Current active theme
    string[] AvailableThemes { get; }      // ["FluentDark", "FluentLight"]
    string PrimaryTheme { get; }           // "FluentDark"
    string FallbackTheme { get; }          // "FluentLight"
    bool IsDarkTheme { get; }              // True if current theme is dark
    bool IsThemeSupported(string theme);   // Check if theme is available
    void ToggleTheme();                    // Switch between themes
    void ApplyTheme(string themeName);     // Apply specific theme
    event EventHandler<string> ThemeChanged; // Theme change notifications
}
```

### Configuration
Theme settings are managed through `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "Theme": "FluentDark",
    "FallbackTheme": "FluentLight",
    "AllowThemeSwitching": true
  }
}
```
