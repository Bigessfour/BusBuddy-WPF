## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Visual Studio 2022** (recommended for WPF development) or **VS Code** with C# extension
- **.NET 8 SDK** (net8.0-windows target framework)
- **SQL Server** (LocalDB, Express, or full instance)
- **Syncfusion License** (Community or Commercial) for WPF UI components
- **Windows 10/11** (WPF requires Windows operating system)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure the connection string in `appsettings.json`
3. **Syncfusion License Key:**
   - Set the `SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable (recommended for security and CI/CD)
   - Or add your license key to `appsettings.json` under `Syncfusion:LicenseKey` or `SyncfusionLicenseKey`
   - The application will not start if the license key is missing (see `App.xaml.cs` for details)
4. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Set the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to control application behavior:
     - `Development`: Enables detailed error messages and sensitive data logging (NEVER use in production)
     - `Staging`: Production-like environment with some debugging features
     - `Production`: Full production mode with security safeguards (default if not set)
   - The application will prevent sensitive data logging in production for security
5. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
6. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run --project BusBuddy.WPF/BusBuddy.WPF.csproj
   ```

### Syncfusion WPF Component Testing
Special considerations for testing Syncfusion WPF UI components:
- **STA Threading**: WPF components require Single-Threaded Apartment model
- **UI Thread Marshaling**: Proper dispatcher usage for WPF UI testing
- **Resource Management**: Comprehensive cleanup of WPF resources and controls
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents test freezing in WPF component initialization
- **Visual Tree Testing**: Testing WPF visual tree and data binding scenarios

## Syncfusion WPF Licensing Compliance

This application uses Syncfusion's professional WPF UI component suite and requires proper licensing:

- **License Registration**: Automatically handled at WPF application startup via environment variable or config file
- **No Legacy Code**: All legacy licensing code has been removed - modern registration only
- **WPF-Specific Components**: Uses only Syncfusion WPF controls (no WinForms or web components)
- **Compliance Documentation**: See [Syncfusion WPF Licensing Documentation](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/licensing/license-key)

### Syncfusion WPF Components Used
- **DockingManager**: Advanced docking and tabbed interfaces
- **DataGrid**: High-performance data grids with sorting/filtering
