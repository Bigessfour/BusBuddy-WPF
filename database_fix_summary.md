# BusBuddy Database Exception Fix Summary

## Issues Identified:

1. **Table Name Mismatch**: DbContext was configured to use "Buses" table but database has "Vehicles" table
2. **Service Dependency Issue**: RoutePopulationScaffold was registered as Singleton but depends on Scoped service
3. **Potential NULL handling issues**: Multiple SQL and InvalidCast exceptions suggest data type mismatches

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Fixed Table Mapping
- Changed `entity.ToTable("Buses")` to `entity.ToTable("Vehicles")` in BusBuddyDbContext.cs
- This aligns the Entity Framework mapping with the actual database schema

### 2. Fixed Service Registration
- Changed RoutePopulationScaffold from AddSingleton to AddScoped in App.xaml.cs
- This resolves the dependency injection lifetime mismatch

### 3. Additional Recommendations:

#### A. Add Null Handling in Queries
Consider adding .Where() clauses to filter out problematic records:

```csharp
// Example for bus queries
var buses = await context.Vehicles
    .Where(v => v.BusNumber != null && v.Make != null && v.Model != null)
    .ToListAsync();
```

#### B. Check Data Types in Database
Run this query to check for data inconsistencies:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Vehicles WHERE 
    BusNumber IS NULL OR 
    Make IS NULL OR 
    Model IS NULL OR 
    Year < 1900 OR 
    Year > 2030
```

#### C. Add Error Handling in Services
Wrap database operations in try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

## Next Steps:
1. Build and test the application
2. Monitor for any remaining exceptions
3. Run database validation queries if issues persist
