# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

This file contains custom instructions for GitHub Copilot when working with this repository.

## XML and XAML Formatting Rules

- In XML/XAML comments, always replace double-dash (`--`) with em dash (`—`)
- Ensure no XML comment ends with a dash character (`-`) by adding a space or period if needed
- Always validate XML comment syntax to ensure it's well-formed
- When adding new comments, use em dashes (`—`) instead of double dashes

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style in the repository
- Use the established Syncfusion FluentDark theme standards for UI components
- Maintain consistent naming conventions for styles, resources, and other identifiers
- Ensure all Syncfusion controls have the proper namespace declarations and theme settings

## Documentation Standards

- Document all public APIs with clear and concise comments
- For complex logic, add explanatory comments that describe the purpose, not just the mechanics
- Use standardized section headers in resource dictionaries and other configuration files
- Maintain clear separation of concerns in documentation sections

## Best Practices

- When suggesting changes, ensure they align with the established patterns in the codebase
- Prioritize maintainability and readability over clever or complex solutions
- When working with XAML UI elements, consider accessibility implications
- Validate that changes don't break existing functionality

These instructions help maintain consistent code quality and style throughout the project.
